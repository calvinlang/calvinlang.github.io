			<p>Today I read that <a href"http://www.informationweek.com/it-life/women-in-it-is-there-an-exodus-in-progress/d/d-id/1320874?itc=edit_in_body_cross">Information week:</a> "According to the National Center for Women and IT, the numbers aren't much better in the US. The organization uses a variety of sources to compile its data, including the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics. The organization reported that in 2012, only 26% of IT jobs were held by women. And while women earned 57% of the undergraduate degrees in the US in 2012, only 18% of computer and information science degrees were earned by women that year. Compare this to 1985, when 37% of CS degrees were earned by women."</p>
			<p>Originally the solution was that if more women were brought into tech, more would be inclined to go with it. However it seems that this system has not had the desired effect and not both the women pursuing and staying in tech has diminished. So what is the solution?</p>
			<p><a href=""></a> article says that the problem isn't in the education model to increase diversity, in fact it is applauded. Bonnie Marsus says: "There’s a bigger issue. It’s the culture. We can attempt to solve the problem by educating more women and minorities and challenging hiring practices which are all important initiatives, but the underlying issue that must be addressed to solve this problem is the hidden and often overt discrimination that prevails in the tech industry." and "The reality is that gender and racial bias is so ubiquitous in the technology industry that it forces talented female and minority employees to leave. Companies can hire more minorities and women but without addressing this critical issue, they will not experience improvement in diversity."</p>

			<p>Now, I have a pet peeve about people stating problems without trying to think of solutions. This is an excellent article that lays of a plan for how to tackle this problem. First let's note that there is an mishap in the thinking of the past 2 decades. The idea was that if supply (women/diversity) increased, the culture would change. This didn't turn out to be the case. So we change this construct around:</p>
			<p>If we change the culture, the supply will increase.</p>
			<p>Companies should take certain steps to improve this aspect and over time we will see that the IT sector will increase in diversities seeking to pursue this career.</p>
			
			<p>These methods should involve sponsoring mentorship and coaching in aspects of career development, networking, and self-promotion. Which I realize this is a way of saying we want minorities to adjust to fit the culture. Yes, but there is some give and take. I beleive they can mold into each other.</p>

			<p>More imporant though is that we focus also on thorough assessments of our own establishments in terms of culture. This assessment can come from outside firms to address racial and gender issues. Second, training on unconscious bias is a valuable method of affecting the culture. I believe over time the culture will mold to be a place that fosters diversity which will increase the drive for minorities pursuing IT sector careers.</p>
