        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Calvin and I’m an aspiring software developer. I was born and raised in Hong Kong before moving to Chicago where I learned biology before getting my masters in Medical Lab Science at Rush University Hospital. I have worked as a medical technologist before moving back to Hong Kong to function as a scientific officer for a diagnostic lab in Hong Kong. This meant I did anything that was did not have a procedure, including writing procedure. The most memorable project I had was creating an automated reporting system for the cervical cancer screening guidelines that would pull results from patient information, HPV and pap smear results. This department developed all their reports in FileMaker, so spent weeks learning everything I could about this platform. I caught the developer bug. I became obsessed with making this work as best as I could. Over a year later I still get giddy thinking about how my code is off galavanting and doing its own work, running and making things better.</p>
        <p>I learned that there was a world where the goal was to be a better learner. To always strive to build wonderful things with purpose. To get to work in a place where you are trying to solve a problem and build an idea exhilarates me.</p>
        <p>When I had time off from school, I learned how to build furniture. It was something I’d always wanted to do. So I got an electric drill and a circular saw. I bought a book and watched YouTube videos and it became a passion of mine to take discarded pieces of lumber and build my furniture with it. It has been a fantastic avocation, learning how to do things safely, repurposing and designing. Learning woodworking is also about being a learner, every new thing you build becomes a different puzzle to solve.</p>
        <p>I love hiking with my dog in Hong Kong. Watching cooking competitions like Master Chef and then trying out a new recipe is a weekly ritual. Working out is an interesting way for me to feel like I’m leveling up in a video game. Something quirky about me? I feel very uncomfortable with shampoo bottles that are kept upside down. I don’t know what it is, it just feels so unhygienic to me!</p>

        <p>My name is Calvin Lang and I am an aspiring developer. I'm currently enrolled at DevBootCamp Chicago in the Chorus Frogs Cohort. I love projects, any kind of project. I created this blog as a place for me to show what I'm working on both in software development and my life. My interests are woodworking, medical science, productivity, nutrition, and weight training.</p>
