			<p>We all need loops. They are a fundamental part of programming. So what if we are in a situation we have to loop the same content several times? Well it doesn't make sense to use an each loop over and over. We could just use a while loop, but if we want to refactor this into something simpler a cycle loop may be what you're looking for.</p>

			<p>Let's say you're making an array and you want to make a list of Monday through Friday for 4 weeks. Instead of using a while loop or a .each loop we can simply use .cycle for 4 weeks. Another situation is we may want to have a list of 50 rolls of a dice. Instead of creating a method that calls the loop 50 rolls, we can simply use cycle 50 for our method that </p>

			<p>For the enumerator #cycle, if it is not passed a block it will return and Enumerator. Let's say we have an array of the days of the week and we pass it array.cycle without the code block.</p>

			<div class="codeblock">
			<p>day = day_of_week.cycle</p>
			<p>day.next</p>
			<p>Monday</p>
			<p>day.next</p>
			<p>Tuesday</p>
