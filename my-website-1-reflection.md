* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
	* "So online there's a set of files you want to work on. We could just drag it to your computer but if we use GitHub we can have a management system that allows us to track changes and push/pull versions we have. This way collaboration can occur without so many errors between us. We call these "repositories." We go to the GitHub site with our repository and and on the right side we copy the link. Then in our terminal to the folder we want to place the repository and we enter "git clone " and paste the link. Press enter and it's done!""
* Describe what open source means.
	* We use the open source MIT license which means we can use, copy, and modify the software as we wish. We can even modify and sell it if we like! The main restriction is that we accompany the software with a license agreement.
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
	* I have mixed feelings about this. It's sort of how I feel about having free music or media in a society that has high demand for it but does not want to pay for it. However, if software developers choose to create software that's open source it's up to them and I respect that. I also think it creates a bigger market that allows more to be done. We've seen that if you are a professional chef, you don't keep your recipe a secret. No one has done that, if anything we've seen this amazing culinary boom in large part because people have been transparent even to the extent of teaching people how to cook their dishes at home. Has this crippled the culinary industry? No. If anything it's created this market that eating good high-end food is not a part of cultural norm. I think open-source accomplishes this and it goes both ways. By making software incredibly available so much advancement can be made and as its value increases, the world has generated so much more demand. It's a fascinating view of economics. I've convinced myself. I like it!
* Assess the importance of using licenses.
	* It's important for developers to elaborate how they want their work to be available to other developers, and if they want have it protected. Open-source is terrific, but developers should use it only if they choose to. So using licenses is great for protecting intellectual copyright if someone chooses. 
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
	* I didn't have any trouble with this challenge but I had a LOT of trouble with git in general. My trouble had a lot to do with syntax. What is this "origin" thing. I thought that was another branch for about an hour and couldn't figure out what was going on. I also at one point accidentally made changes to my master branch and didn't know how to make my making-changes branch push to git because it was older. I still am confused on the merge function.
	* I did have an aha moment regarding pulling late at night and I ended up staying up till 3 in the morning and I'm exhausted. I'd rather have aha moments earlier in the day!
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	* [Git reference](http://gitref.org/basic/) was excellent for helping me understand how the functions of each syntax. It explains each step conversationally.
