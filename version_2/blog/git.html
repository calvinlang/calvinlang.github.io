          <h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
            <p>
              So I'm going through my first week of assignments and things are not coming as easily         as possible. Is this the life of a developer? You find something interesting that you         don't understand and discover it by a series of epiphanies? It certainly seems that         way! I like it. It's a lot of problem solving and being on a mode of trying to figure         out what is going on. It's such a different world. I recall watching this episode of        Star Trek Voyager where a piece of technology from the 29th century falls into the        hands of Ed Begley Junior in the 60's man. His character engineered them to become a      technology mogul. I've often wondered if I had piece of futuristic technology what        could I manage to do with it. Or if I went back in time and gave Thomas Edison an        iPhone. Well I feel like learning to be a developer is like this and it's quite a        journey of figuring out one little part at a time and putting it all together.

                What is GitHub?
                GitHub is a website where developers create profiles that they can share the        software they developed. A lot of it is open-source, meaning that you are free to       use and modify their work for your own purposes. It has the ability to be a       collaboration tool that makes sure that you are using the most recent version     available. This way you have version control.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've ever worked in a group where you're trying to work on documents together,         you know there is no perfect solution. I recall once writing a procedure for        phlebotomy (blood drawing). So I created all the content and I wanted to make sure        everything was correct before I started to change the formatting. So I sent out the       document to all the laboratory managers to look over my work. After a week I      started making formatting changes, moving one section elsewhere, changing fonts,       and creating headers. Then I get an e-mail with my document edited and a manager       saying "I made some changes!" UGH! So I had to go through the work tediously trying     to find all the changes in new places and wasted 2 days making adjustments. This is        bureaucracy! It's paganism if you ask me. Wouldn't it be great if there was a       collaboration tool that managed these issues for us? If time was gold it would be       worth its weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Well that's one of the benefits GitHub provides. It allows you to use the most         recent version of a document available instead of a word doc you sent out a week        ago. You can track changes and this allows version control. 
            </p>
              <p> 
                  GitHub is great for storing code because it has the latest version available. You         can put a massive amount of information on there to be shared and it keeps an         updated version for you to work on from anywhere. 
              </p>
