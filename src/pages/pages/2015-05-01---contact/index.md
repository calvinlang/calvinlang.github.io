Right now I'm focused on a product called Cualia. It is an application for medical labs to verify the performance of their medical instruments.

Method Verification in medical laboratory science is a niche subject in a niche industry. But I think we've seen from certain incidents in medical testing during the COVID crisis that reliable testing is at utmost importance. Many laboratories don't do this because of the high barrier of entry from not having the right tools and resources available.

With my background in laboratory, I feel I should spearhead this project to bring a modern verification system to the medical setting.

If you'd like to hear more about this feel free to reach out to me.
