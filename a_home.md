<!-- Welcome to my site! I am currently on a journey to being a software developer and going through DevBootCamp. This is a place for me to put in my experiences with programming, talk about the projects I'm working on, and blog about idea and thoughts.

My background is varied, from laboratory medicine to woodworking. I may blog on topics ranging from how to safely use a tablesaw, how to prep a whole week's food in 3 hours, to how I can still remember by memory the phenotypic characteristics of gram negative rods, all the way to my favorite Ruby enumerables. 

For now this will come slowly as I'm learning a lot about how the internet works. There's all this fantastic code being written everywhere doing its good in the world. I want to contribute to this, so right now my real focus learning what I can about programming. -->
