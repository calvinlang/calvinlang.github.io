How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
    Our experience may not have been conventional because I was more familiar with tables in HTML than my pair. However we had a fantastic collaborative experience where since I had more comfort I was navigator. We worked on the wireframe until we were done and my partner felt comfortable with the syntax of tables. 
    It was actually more enriching in the sense that we both got a lot more comfortable with peer pairing because we increased our time commitment. Most of the time was my pair trying to figure how to make the tables work and me observing and giving direction. I learned a lot about how to communicate to my peer that I felt we were in this assigment together but just as important was expressing that it was important to me that they felt good about what we did. 
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    It was helpful because I've never made a web site before, so having a framework that I knew I had planned what would go where was very helpful.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
    We both liked a simple clean look with the title and an image to be a lead in to the full post.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
    I'm not familiar with the term semantic elements so I just looked up this site: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp. We didn't end up working with the semantic elements much but we modified tables a lot and I don't know if it falls in that category.
