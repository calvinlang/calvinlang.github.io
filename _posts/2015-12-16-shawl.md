I like to be prepared. I always carry my <a href="https://aperabags.com/">Apera Tech Pack</a> and inisde I keep a small first aid kit, umbrella, my leatherman (with screwdriver set), USB battery pack, a set of clean clothes, and a shawl.

A shawl? Why a shawl? Calvin, why would you keep a shawl in your bag? This is the one I keep in my bag and measures about 6ft by 3.5ft. I got it in Vanuatu while travelling. It cost me $2 US.

When you're carrying a backpack that you take everywhere, you want everything inside to have a really good size to use ratio. If you take public transport you want to be prepared yet light on your feet. I've compiled this list of uses for shawls and you'll see why in my opinion it has such a good size:use ratio that I think it's crucial.

####First of all: why shawls are nice
1. Look nice
2. Cheap
3. Reusable
4. Replaceable
5. Easy to clean
6. Light
7. Folds to a small size

####Uses for shawls
1. Great conversation starter. Why, sir, do you carry a shawl?
2. Cover yourself up if you're feeling cold.
3. Acts as a tablecloth.
4. Cover your chair or table to claim it while you go to the bathroom.
5. Organize items by placing it on the shawl.
6. Beach or picnic towel (and the sand falls right off). 
7. Fold into a cushion when sitting on a hard surface. I will make a cushion against a window on the bus.
8. Clean up a spill.
9. Use it as an bag or a sack.
10. Emergency rope to tie something down.
11. Use it as a scarf.
12. Use it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLHVdZoNJAM">exercise</a>.
13. Use it for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJosrq1OHRg">stretching</a>. Really the most underrated stretching tool. Excellent for shoulder dislocates as well. 
14. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH-VEOKVzMw">Carry a baby</a>.
15. Bleeding? Wrap your shawl tight around the wound.
16. When confronted by an aggressive dog, wrap it around your arm to protect yourself if it attacks.
17. Wrap it around your hand if you need to touch something hot.
18. Wrap it around something greasy that you need to grip (think auto emergencies).
19. Emergency sling if you break your arm.
20. Rip off pieces of your shawl for emergency fire starter.
21. Rip off lengths for emergency rope
22. Wrap it around your waist if you soil your jeans.
23. Cover your mouth if the air is toxic.

This is a really good list of uses for a shawl. Especially in emergency situations to wrap it around a wound or act as an arm sling. Considering how light it is and how little space it takes up in your bag, you might as well keep one in your own EDC. Contact me if you think of any more uses!
